# RedditHelper

This project is very basic and is meant to help memebers of the HamRadio community that are visually impaired to be able to enjoy the posts on the hamradio subreddits or other subreddits.

Firstly if you have not done this prior you need to install pip

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ - this link details how to install pip for your os

To properly use this you have to install all the necessary libraries. To do this you can simply go to your command prompt and type:

pip install praw

pip install gTTS

pip install textwrap

pip install playsound

pip install PIL

pip install tkinter

pip install requests

pip install pygame

pip install re 

Once you have installed the necesseary libraries you can then download the file and use it accordingly.

**How to use program**

The program can be utilized by simply typing in the subreddit you would like to view then clicking next post and having the TTS read it to you. If there is an image it will give you the choice of displaying it.

**Limitations** 

The program does not display images and can be slow as it is downloadding entire mp3 files and playing them.

**QUESTIONS**

If you are confused or find an issue with the program please email me and I will try and get back with you and fix the issue. I hope this helps whoever would like to use it and thank you for your time with checking this out! 73!
